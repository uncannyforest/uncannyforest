🦜 🌲 🌖  Hi, I’m the author of the Uncanny Forest webcomic at [uncannyforest.com](https://uncannyforest.com), which is also the closest thing I have to a personal website. This is my GitHub account for personal projects.

👨‍🏫 I used to work as a software engineer, including in "Big Tech".  I currently work in computer science education.

📜 I like to write fiction.  Although I've written a few short stories, that hobby has been mostly been funneled into writing webcomics and several unfinished computer games.

🌃 Remember the After Dark screensavers from the 90's?  No?  Anyway, I'm their #1 fan.

👨‍🌾 I dress like a city hipster now, but I grew up on a farm bordered by a river and several forests, one with apple trees, one hiding a quiet inlet of the river, and one which was known as the Secret Forest.
